## About PCOS -
PCOS is a  common hormonal disorder among women of reproductive age. Factors that might play a role include: excess insulin, low-grade inflammation, excess androgen, or it can be hereditary. The signs and symptoms of PCOS may vary woman to woman; some signs of PCOS include irregular periods, excess androgen and polycystic ovaries. 
## Diagnosis Techniques -
There is no test to definitively diagnose PCOS. Disease prediction is a challenging task in healthcare applications. However, the test requires the patient to report back to the hospital or test-centre. Often, due to inconveniences the women patients fail to visit the hospital to get the diagnostic details. Machine learning is an emerging approach that helps in the prediction, diagnosis of a disease.
